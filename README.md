This project focuses on analyzing and predicting traffic accidents in five major cities of TÃ¼rkiye (Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, and Konya) from **2021 to 2024**. The study uses machine learning models, including **Linear Regression (LR)** and **Random Forest Regressor (RFR)**, to predict accident trends, deaths, and injuries. The goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners to improve road safety and reduce traffic-related incidents.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to traffic accidents.
  - Visualization of accident hotspots, severity, and frequency across major cities in TÃ¼rkiye.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Predictive models to forecast accident severity, deaths, and injuries.
  - Comparison of **Linear Regression (LR)** and **Random Forest Regressor (RFR)** models using evaluation metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared (RÂ²)**.

- **Geospatial Analysis**:
  - Mapping of accident-prone areas using geospatial tools.

- **Comprehensive Insights**:
  - Detailed analysis of monthly and yearly accident trends from 2021 to 2024.
